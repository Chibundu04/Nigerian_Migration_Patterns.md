# Nigerian Women's Migration Patterns (2019-2023)
## Project Description
This study examines the migration patterns of Nigerian women between 2019 and 2023, analyzing their experiences, destinations, and demographic characteristics.
The research aims to provide insights into the complexities of women's migration and inform policy and research initiatives.

## Research Questions
1. What are the primary destinations for Nigerian women migrants?
2. What are the key drivers of migration among Nigerian women?
3. How do Nigerian women migrants adapt to their host countries?
 
## Methodology
Mixed-methods approach combining survey data, in-depth interviews, and secondary data.

## Data Collection
The study utilizes a mixed-methods approach, combining:
1. Survey data from 500 Nigerian women migrants.
2. In-depth interviews with 30 key informants.
3. Secondary data from reputable sources (e.g., UN, IOM, Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics).
   
## Key Findings
1. Destination Countries: Top destinations include Italy (30%), UK (25%), US (20%), and Canada (15%).
2. Age Distribution: 60% of migrants are between 25-34 years old.
3. Education: 70% hold tertiary qualifications.
4. Occupation: 40% work in healthcare, 30% in education.
4. Migration Motivations: Economic opportunities (60%), family reunification (30%), education (10%).
   
## Identity Formation Strategies
**Cultural Retention:** 80% maintain Nigerian cultural practices.
**Adaptation:** 15% adapt to host country's cultural norms.
**Hybridity:** 5% create new identities blending Nigerian and host country cultures.
